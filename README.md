# orm-mybatis

This is a simplified version of the MyBatis framework.

Some improvements were made on a simplified version of the framework written by an upperclassman on GitHub.

See the code for details of specific improvements.

The warehouse records the UML class diagrams made in the process of learning the code of senior students, the notes written in the process of understanding, the websites searched when they encountered problems in the process of improving themselves, and the SQL files of the database used in testing the code.

If you want to learn more, it is recommended to read the original address of the senior's introduction to his framework, readme.md (which records the senior's thinking process of writing the framework), and then come back to the source code.

I hope it's helpful to you.

If you find any mistakes during your reading, please mention them. Thank you very much.

这是一个简化版的 Mybatis框架。

在GitHub上的一位学长手写的简化版框架之上做了部分改进。

具体改进的细节，详见代码。

仓库中记录了参考学习学长代码过程中所做的 UML类图、理解过程中写的笔记、自己改进过程中遇到问题时搜索的网站、测试代码时所用的数据库的 sql文件。

如果你想深入学习，建议阅读原版地址学长对其框架的介绍 README.md（记录了学长写框架的思考过程），再回来看这个源码。

希望对你有所帮助。

如果在阅读过程中发现错误，请您提出，非常感谢。
